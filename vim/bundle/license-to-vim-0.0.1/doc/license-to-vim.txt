1. Intro                                              *LicenseToVim*

If you've done any kind of programming, chances are you've seen a
license or two in a project tree. Perhaps you've even inserted one
of those licenses yourself! If so, you've probably noticed that
it's inconvenient to copy licenses around all the time, enter your
name, etc. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just make licenses
magically appear in your code? Maybe even without leaving Vim? In
case you don't see where I'm going with this, the License To Vim
plugin makes this all possible!

====================================================================
2. Funtionality provided                 *LicenseToVimFunctionality*

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1. Global commands                    *LicenseToVimGlobalCommands*

:License(<license>)                                       *:License*
    Inserts the full text of <license> at the top of the file. The
    license name should be given in single quotes. See section 2.2
    for a list of the available licenses. Calling this function on
    an unrecognized license causes an error.

:Stub(<license>)                                             *:Stub*
    Inserts the stub version of <license> at the top of the file.
    As with |:License|, the name should be given in single quotes
    and should match one of the licenses listed in section 2.2.
    Licenses available for this function correspond to those marked
    "Yes" under "Has Stub". Calling this function on a license
    marked "No" or an otherwise unrecognized license will cause an
    error.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. Licenses available              *LicenseToVimLicensesAvailable*

table below. There's the full license name, the abbreviation of the

can specify MIT or MiT rather than mit if you so choose.

3. Options                                     *LicenseToVimOptions*

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1. Option summary                      *LicenseToVimOptionSummary*

The plugin provides the following options that can customize the
behavior of License To Vim. These should be set in your vimrc (or
equivalent file).

|'loaded_licensetovim'| Disables the plugin.

|'license_author'|      Provides a name to automatically be inserted
                        into the license text when applicable.

|'license_email'|       Provides an email address to automatically
                        be inserted into the license text when
                        applicable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2. Option details                      *LicenseToVimOptionDetails*

To enable any of the options detailed below, you should put the
given line into your .vimrc (or equivalent).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                                             *'loaded_licensetovim'*
Values: 0 or 1
Default: 0

Maybe you just don't want this thing, in which case you can turn it
off. Just use this line: >
    let g:loaded_licensetovim = 1
<

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                  *'license_author'*
Values: Any string
Default: Not set

Licenses for which an author should be specified contain the text
{AUTHOR}. If the |'license_author'| option is set, {AUTHOR} is
replaced with the set value. Otherwise {AUTHOR} is left as-is. Use
this line to set the option: >
    let g:license_author = 'Your Full Name'
<

--------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                   *'license_email'*
Values: Any string
Default: Not set

A few licenses provide a spot for the author's email to be entered.
In those cases, the license text contains the placeholder {EMAIL},
which will be replaced with the value of |'license_email'| if set.
Otherwise {EMAIL} is left as-is. Use this line to set the option: <
    let g:license_email = 'you@example.com'
<

4. About                                         *LicenseToVimAbout*

License To Vim was created by some guy named Alex Arslan. He's
honestly not that great at Vim and this is his first time making a
Vim plugin. He's pretty sure it works though.

Oh yeah, and he'd like to thank KeyboardFire for his help, support,
and feedback. He'd also like to thank you! Yes you!

====================================================================
5. License                                     *LicenseToVimLicense*

License To Vim is licensed under the same terms as Vim itself. For
details, see :help license.
